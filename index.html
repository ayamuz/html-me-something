                <h3>Bailey (Boo&#174;)</h3>
                <p>Bailey used to be one of the dogs of my brother in-law, Ian. He and Caidye have a second dog, Connor, and a Toddler, Gabriel. They thought that Bailey needed more attention because she's a really anxious and energetic dog, so they asked if we wanted to take care of her. AND RENEE AND I SAID YES. She's a sweet and barky dog.</p>

                <h3>Panda</h3>
                <p>Panda is one of our two sibling cats. He was the smallest from the batch but he is feisty and courageous. He has catched up with his brother, Penguin, and now jumps and tries to climb our legs whenever we are cooking at the kitchen.</p>

                <h3>Penguin</h3>
                <p>This little guy looks like he had a bad haircut but still rocks it. Sometimes he looks magestic and sometimes he lookjs silly. Over all, he is a sweaty and likes to groom his brother.</p>
